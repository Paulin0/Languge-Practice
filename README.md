# Languge-Practice

Im making this to help a friend practice their English and as practice for when I make a language website to help me learn Arabic. 

It will be a repository for now.  

It will probably be like add 1 new page a week unless I figure how to make all the hard code I'm doing be automated 

I'm completly re designing the website, hopefully it won't be too ugly
